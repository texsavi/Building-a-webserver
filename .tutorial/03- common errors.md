I've copied the code from `@app.route('/')` to create `@app.route('/home')`, but I now have **two subroutines called index**. This is what is creating the error. We can't have two subroutines with the same name.

```python
@app.route('/')
def index(): 
  page = f"""<html><body>
  <p><a href = "/home">Go home</a></p>
  </body>
  </html>"""
  return page

@app.route('/home') 
def home(): 
```

```python
from flask import Flask
import datetime # import the datetime library

app = Flask(__name__)


```

I've missed the path to the static folder, so none of my images/videos, etc. will load.

```python
from flask import Flask
import datetime

app = Flask(__name__, static_url_path="/static") 
```
